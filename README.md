# SPEAR---Storm-Surge-Modelling

This project includes six QGIS models for storm surge height modelling. These models were created to facilitate faster processing of storm surge simulations, following the Recommended Practice for Storm Surge Modelling provided on UN-SPIDER's knowledge portal.

Each file corresponds to a different storm surge model with varying flood heights.
The model "ModelDEM_Waterlevel1-5m" includes flood height simulations from 1 m to 5 m. This is the fastest method if you want to quickly generate storm surge heights from 1 m to 5 m in a single run.
Download the models of your choice and integrate them into your QGIS project as outlined in the revised Recommended Practice for Storm Surge Modelling on the Knowledge Portal.
